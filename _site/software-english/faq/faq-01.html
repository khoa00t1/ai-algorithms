A better workload distribution plan could help reduce the need for overtime.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Q: Do you predict any incoming issues you may face during the project?</strong><br /> Yes, I foresee potential challenges with meeting the scalability requirements of the application. Proactive load testing and resource allocation could address this.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Q: Do you see yourself growing better in another department?</strong><br /> Possibly. I am interested in exploring opportunities in the product management department to gain a broader perspective on user needs and business strategy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Q: Do you think we’re collaborating remotely well?</strong><br /> Yes, but there’s room for improvement in using more efficient communication tools, such as a centralized project management platform.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Q: Have you ever missed a personal event due to work?</strong><br /> Yes, on occasion.
