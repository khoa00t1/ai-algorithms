    "title": "Questions and answers related to Design Pattern",
    "content": "Here are questions and answers related to Design Pattern: . General Questions . | Q: What is a design pattern? . | A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem in software design. | . | Q: Why are design patterns important? . | They provide proven solutions, improve code readability, and promote best practices. | . | Q: How are design patterns categorized? . | Design patterns are categorized into three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. | . | Q: What is the difference between a design pattern and an algorithm? . | A design pattern is a high-level solution to a design problem, while an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a computational problem. | . | Q: What are the benefits of using design patterns? . | Benefits include code reusability, scalability, maintainability, and improved communication among developers. | . | . Creational Design Patterns . | Q: What are creational design patterns? . | Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. | . | Q: What is the Singleton pattern? . | The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. | . | Q: What is the Factory Method pattern? . | The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. | . | Q: What is the Abstract Factory pattern? . | The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. | . | Q: What is the Builder pattern? . | The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. | . | Q: What is the Prototype pattern? . | The Prototype pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. | . | Q: When should you use the Singleton pattern? . | Use the Singleton pattern when you need to ensure that only one instance of a class exists and provide a global point of access to it. | . | Q: What are the drawbacks of the Singleton pattern? . | It can make unit testing difficult and may introduce global state into an application. | . | Q: How does the Factory Method differ from the Abstract Factory? . | The Factory Method creates one type of object, while the Abstract Factory creates families of related objects. | . | Q: What are the advantages of the Builder pattern? . | It simplifies the creation of complex objects and makes the code more readable and maintainable. | . | . Structural Design Patterns . | Q: What are structural design patterns? . | Structural patterns deal with object composition and relationships to form larger structures. | . | Q: What is the Adapter pattern? . | The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another. | . | Q: What is the Bridge pattern? . | The Bridge pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. | . | Q: What is the Composite pattern? . | The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. | . | Q: What is the Decorator pattern? . | The Decorator pattern adds new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure. | . | Q: What is the Facade pattern? . | The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, making it easier to use. | . | Q: What is the Flyweight pattern? . | The Flyweight pattern reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. | . | Q: What is the Proxy pattern? . | The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. | . | Q: When should you use the Adapter pattern? . | Use the Adapter pattern when you need to integrate a class with an incompatible interface into your application. | . | Q: What are the benefits of the Composite pattern? . | It simplifies client code by treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. | . | . Behavioral Design Patterns . | Q: What are behavioral design patterns? . | Behavioral patterns deal with communication between objects and how they interact. | . | Q: What is the Chain of Responsibility pattern? . | The Chain of Responsibility pattern passes a request along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it. | . | Q: What is the Command pattern? . | The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests. | . | Q: What is the Interpreter pattern? . | The Interpreter pattern defines a representation for a language’s grammar and provides an interpreter to evaluate sentences in the language. | . | Q: What is the Iterator pattern? . | The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. | . | Q: What is the Mediator pattern? . | The Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling. | . | Q: What is the Memento pattern? . | The Memento pattern captures and restores an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation. | . | Q: What is the Observer pattern? . | The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified. | . | Q: What is the State pattern? . | The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. | . | Q: What is the Strategy pattern? . | The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. | . | Q: What is the Template Method pattern? . | The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. | . | Q: What is the Visitor pattern? . | The Visitor pattern separates an algorithm from the object structure it operates on, allowing you to add new operations without modifying the objects. | . | Q: When should you use the Observer pattern? . | Use the Observer pattern when changes to one object need to be reflected in other objects. | . | Q: What are the advantages of the Strategy pattern? . | It promotes the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new algorithms to be added without modifying existing code. | . | Q: What are the drawbacks of the Mediator pattern? . | It can become a bottleneck if the mediator grows too complex. | . | . Advanced Questions . | Q: How do design patterns promote the SOLID principles? . | Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Strategy align with SOLID principles by promoting single responsibility, open/closed design, and dependency inversion. | . | Q: Can design patterns be combined? . | Yes, design patterns can be combined to solve complex problems. For example, the Factory Method can be used with the Singleton pattern. | . | Q: What is anti-pattern? . | An anti-pattern is a common but ineffective or counterproductive solution to a recurring problem. | . | Q: How do you choose the right design pattern? . | Analyze the problem, consider the context, and choose a pattern that best fits the requirements. | . | Q: Are design patterns language-specific? . | No, design patterns are not tied to any specific programming language and can be implemented in any language. | . | .
